# UHF RFID Tag Wideband Dipole Antenna

This project presents the design and implementation of a UHF RFID Tag wideband dipole antenna, integrated with an Impinj Monza electronic chip. The antenna is designed to operate within the UHF RFID frequency range of 865 MHz to 1.10 GHz, while achieving excellent performance in terms of gain, reflection coefficient (S11), and impedance matching.

## Specifications
